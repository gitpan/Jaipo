Jaipo (宅噗)

This project started for Jaiku.com, but now is going to support
as-much-as-we-can micro-blogging sites.

"Jaiku" pronunced close to "宅窟" in Chinese, which means an area full of
computer/internet users, and it really is one of the most popular sites
recently. As jaiku is part of google and growing, there're still only few linux
client.

it's writen in perl, so it can run on any platform that you can get perl on it.
we got the first feedback that somebody use it on ARM embedded system at May 2008.

Now you can read feeds, send message, and set location with Jaipo.

HISTORY 

This project was started by BlueT, which simply used Net::Jaiku to 
post,review Jaiku message by script.

c9s loves using twitter/plurk. so he ask bluet to develop jaipo as a module
together and let jaipo works for other services like Jaiku, Plurk.. etc.  so we
rewrite it into a module. and let the jaipo console interface looks like cpan
interface.  

Jaipo now provides console interface, but more sophisticate
gui with clutter or gtk in the future.
